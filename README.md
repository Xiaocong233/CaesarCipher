## Description
This another one of my program wrote for CS50x Pset2 on edX in C. What it does is outputting enciphered message from user's input of a message and a numerical key. According to Caesar’s algorithm, this program should automatically encrypts user's input message by “rotating” each letter by user's input of key. Sadly, this is restricted to alphabetical messages only ;-;

## Usage
```
$ make caesar
$ ./caesar key #key being any integers
```

## What I have learned
* Using argument count and argument vector to manipulate user's commandline input
* Checking if a variable is an integer
* Converting integer from string in C
* Implementing caesar cipher
