# CaesarCipher
This another one of my program wrote for CS50x Pset2 on edX in C. What it does is output enciphered message from user's input of a message and a numerical key. According to Caesar’s algorithm, this program should automatically encrypts user's input message by “rotating” each letter by user's input of key. Sadly, this is restricted to alphabetical messages only ;-;
